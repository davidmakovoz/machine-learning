    "# Topic Modeling\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to compare several algorithms used for topic modeling by clustering a set of documents. The following approaches are compared:\n",
    "- Non-negative Matrix Factorization - NMF\n",
    "- Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA\n",
    "- KMeans\n",
    "- Doc2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "# Text Representions\n",
    "Machine learning algorithms are primarily designed to process numerical data. Therefore text has to be converted to some type of numerical representation. There are two approaches to convert text to numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, the first approach to this problem is the vector space model. In the vector space model the collection of all words define the dimensions of the space with one dimension per word. A document is represented as a vector in that space with several options of how to define the actual coordinates of the document in the space: \n",
    "- binary - 1 if the word is present in the document, 0 if it isn't\n",
    "- tf - the number of occurences of the word in the document, often normalized by the number of words in the document\n",
    "- tfidf - term frequency inverse document frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of documents is represented as a document-word matrix, a full cartesian product of all document vectors. Another way to think of this is that a collection of documents is a set of points in an n-dimensional space. Consequently, 'regular' clustering algorithms, such as KMeans or DBSCAN, can be applied. \n",
    "Most of the algorithms in this notebook use the vector space model: NMF and KMeans use the tfidf representation and LDA uses the tf represenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with this approach is that if a resonable vocabulary - a few tens of thousands of words - is used each document is a sparse vector in a very high-dimensional space. \n",
    "It is possible to define the concept of similarity between two documents. However, for individual words such concept cannot be defined. \n",
    "\n",
    "The word embedding approach addresses these problems. Each word is represented as a vector in a space with a number of dimensions much smaller than in the vector space model, anywhere from tens to hundreds of dimensions. The coordinates of the vectors, aka word embedding, are computed as part of a process thath uses words to predict words found in their vicinity. There are two basic approaches: the Continuous Bag-of-Words (COW) model and the Skip-Gram model ([original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781)). The benefit of this approach is that the concept of similarity can be applied to the individual words, i.e. words with similary meaning are 'closer' to each other than words with different meaning in the embedded space. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach works well for processing text as a sequence of words, or even characters, in such problems as machine translation, sentence tagging, etc. \n",
    "However, it presents a difficulty when there is a need to process a collection of documents. With each word being a vector, a document becomes a matrix - rank2 tensor, and a collection of documents becomes a rank 3 tensor. \n",
    "Another complication is that documents in a collection can be of very different sizes. To deal with this problem smaller documents a padded with 0's. This may not be such a problem for small documents, such as tweets, but comparing longer documents with large length variability creates a problem. There are options: to pad all documents to match the longest one, which results  in unnecessary increase in memory use, or to truncate the longer documents, which leads to the loss of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doc2Vec is an extension of word2vec . Doc2vec address both problems, it creates a vector represenation of documents regarless of their sizes, so that a collection of documents is equivalent to a set of points in an n-dimensional space. The details of how this approach works can be found e.g. in [here](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) and the references within it. Here we present application of Doc2vec to document clustering. "

The clustering will also assign each article a number from 0 to 19 based on which cluster it is in, but there is only 1 in 20 chance that cluster 0 corresponds to class 0, since those cluster number is assignment is random and has nothing to do with the actuall classes. \n",

It is easy for a clustering algorithm to maximize one or the other of these two metrics if the number of clusters is not fixed: assigning each data sample to it's own cluster yields the homogeneity score = 1, assigning all data points to 1 cluster yields the completeness score = 1.

      " |      This object essentially contains the mapping between words and embeddings. After training, it can be used\n",

      " |      to capture the paragraph.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      In this way we can capture the difference between the same word used in a different context.\n",
      " |      For example we now have a different representation of the word \"leaves\" in the following two sentences ::\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |          1. Manos leaves the office every day at 18:00 to catch his train\n",

      " |      a single projection and hidden layer which we train on the corpus. The weights are then used as our embeddings\n",
      " |      The only addition to the underlying NN used in :class:`~gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec` is that the input\n",

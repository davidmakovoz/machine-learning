      "MGM still responding to wide-ranging cyberattack as rumors run rampantLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterThe Las Vegas Strip in 2022. Image: Kevin Dunlap via UnsplashJonathan GreigSeptember 14th, 2023MGM still responding to wide-ranging cyberattack as rumors run rampantUpdate (8:10 pm): Ransomware hackers connected to the BlackCat/Alphv gang took credit for the cyberattack Thursday afternoon in a 1,000-word message posted to its website. The hackers claimed they had access to MGM Resorts' Okta and Azure environments starting on Friday and gained administrator privileges, allowing them widespread access to the company's systems. The group's statement could not immediately be verified, and MGM did not respond to a request for comment about the allegations. MGM Resorts is still struggling to recover from a cyberattack that has hampered significant parts of its business. The hospitality giant, which controls multiple hotels and casinos across Las Vegas as well as properties across the U.S., has not responded to requests for comment but said on Thursday that it continues to \"work diligently to resolve our cybersecurity issue while addressing individual guest needs promptly.\" \"We couldn't do this without the thousands of incredible employees who are committed to guest service and support from our loyal customers,\" the company said. Since Monday — when the company confirmed that it shut down some systems after identifying a cybersecurity issue — its website has been down and customers have reported widespread issues with everything from slot machines to room keys. Customers have shared photos and videos of temporary measures the casinos are taking to continue operations while systems are down, including providing visitors with radios to communicate with staff and tallying slot machine losses or wins by hand. Rumors have run rampant as customers and employees search for answers about the situation. The company owns several high-profile Las Vegas properties, including Mandalay Bay, the Bellagio, the Cosmopolitan and the Aria. Employees are now fearful that they will not be paid on Friday and due to the company’s size, several ancillary businesses are warning their employees to be wary of “emails, files and electronic communications.” MGM Resorts reported the issue to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, noting that law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts are now involved in the response. “Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working diligently to resolve the matter. The Company will continue to implement measures to secure its business operations and take additional steps as appropriate,” it said. MGM Resorts reported that brought in about $25 million per day in the third quarter of 2022, meaning the hotel is likely losing millions each day with the outages affecting dozens of slot machines and other resort functions. Scattered Spider, 0ktapus and Caesars While MGM has refused to specify the nature of the cyberattack, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that it was a ransomware incident, backing up claims relayed to the malware research platform vx-underground that an affiliate of the Black Cat/AlphV ransomware gang was behind the attack. A notable affiliate of the gang — known by researchers as Scattered Spider or 0ktapus — reportedly told vx-underground directly that they gained access to MGM’s systems by searching for employees on LinkedIn and spoofing the IT help desk. Reuters spoke to two sources that confirmed Scattered Spider was behind the incident. Scattered Spider has made a name for itself with several high-profile attacks, including one on Coinbase in February. The group — which is allegedly made up of U.S. and U.K.-based hackers — has shown skill with social-engineering techniques. A report from cybersecurity company Group-IB said a recent phishing campaign by the group resulted in 9,931 accounts from more than 136 organizations being compromised — including Riot Games, Reddit and Twilio. While Scattered Spider was initially identified as involved only in data theft, in recent months they allegedly have coordinated with the Black Cat/AlphV ransomware gang — with several recent victims showing up on the group’s leak site. Group-IB calls the group “0ktapus” because it targets users of tech company Okta’s identity and access management services. Typically it sends victims to lookalike pages to steal Okta credentials. “The methods used by this threat actor are not special, but the planning and how it pivoted from one company to another makes the campaign worth looking into,” said Rustam Mirkasymov, head of cyber threat research at Group-IB Europe. “0ktapus shows how vulnerable modern organizations are to some basic social engineering attacks and how far-reaching the effects of such incidents can be for their partners and customers.” Members of the group spoke to the Financial Times and TechCrunch this week, claiming their original goal was to attack MGM’s slot machines only and use paid mules to slowly milk the devices. But when that failed, they turned to their tried-and-true methods of attack, eventually encrypting the company’s systems. According to Telegram conversations with both outlets, the hackers were able to exploit remote login software and leaked VPN account information from MGM employees to move throughout the company’s system. Four sources told Bloomberg that the same group used a similar method to attack another casino giant — Caesars Entertainment — just weeks ago. The hackers who spoke to Financial Times and TechCrunch denied being part of the attack on Caesars Entertainment. Caesars Entertainment reported its attack to the SEC last week, explaining that the hackers gained copies of their loyalty program database, which includes driver’s license numbers and/or social security numbers for a significant number of members in the database. “We have taken steps to ensure that the stolen data is deleted by the unauthorized actor, although we cannot guarantee this result. We are monitoring the web and have not seen any evidence that the data has been further shared, published, or otherwise misused,” the company said, tacitly confirming reports that they paid a ransom to the hackers. The casino reportedly paid a $15 million ransom after being asked for $30 million. ‘Impossible to prevent’ Kory Daniels, CISO of cybersecurity company Trustwave, said that in the gaming and casino industry, the magnitude of transactions and the wealth of personal data make it a prime target. A recent report from the company on the hospitality industry found at least 59 ransomware attacks and that the top attack method involved credential access. A source from the cybersecurity industry told Recorded Future News that MGM Resorts’ Microsoft Exchange Servers are “highly outdated and vulnerable to probably every vulnerability since 2021.” “I just got curious and checked their domain in a public scanner called http://LeakIX.net, which is where I found that their Exchange was last patched in 2021,” the source said, requesting anonymity to speak freely about the findings. “Means they had several critical vulns in there. The server is still up at time of writing.” Other researchers confirmed that a database containing information linked to MGM Resorts was posted on a well-known hacking forum months before the attack was announced. This is not the first time MGM has dealt with a hacking incident. The company’s online sports betting company BetMGM reported a breach in December that involved the names, Social Security numbers and financial information of an unknown number of customers. In 2020, the personal information of 10.6 million users who stayed at MGM Resorts was leaked to a hacking forum. Steve Hahn, executive vice president at cybersecurity firm BullWall, said casinos have some of the largest attack surfaces out there. “Every IoT device presents the threat actors with another attack vector. I spoke to a casino that was hit recently that had the attack initiate on a temperature sensor in a large aquarium on their property,” he said. “Ransomware is also nearly impossible to prevent from a focused and dedicated threat actor.”Cybercrime NewsNewsIndustry NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsgamblinghotelLas VegascyberattackMGM0ktapusAlphvhospitality industryScattered SpiderNo previous articleNo new articlesJonathan Greigis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

      "Manchester police officers’ data stolen following ransomware attack on supplierLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Wikimedia Commons / Ilovetheeu / CC BY-SA 4.0Alexander MartinSeptember 14th, 2023Manchester police officers’ data stolen following ransomware attack on supplierA ransomware attack on a third-party supplier has compromised the personal details of thousands of officers with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in North West England. Although neither financial information nor home addresses were exposed in the incident according to GMP, the risk of officers’ personal details being obtained by organized crime groups — including those working in undercover roles — has prompted the involvement of the National Crime Agency. GMP Assistant Chief Constable Colin McFarlane said: “We are aware of a ransomware attack affecting a third-party supplier of various UK organizations, including GMP, which holds some information on those employed by GMP.” Ransomware attacks on British organizations reached record levels last year, as Recorded Future News reported this week, when at least 5.3 million people had their data stolen in cyber extortion incidents. The force employs just over 11,000 people and polices a territory with a population of approximately 2.7 million. The third-party supplier has not been named but was identified as based in Stockport by BBC News. “We understand how concerning this is for our employees so, as we work to understand any impact on GMP, we have contacted the Information Commissioner's Office and are doing everything we can to ensure employees are kept informed, their questions are answered, and they feel supported. “This is being treated extremely seriously, with a nationally-led criminal investigation into the attack,” added assistant chief constable McFarlane. It follows another incident affecting the Metropolitan Police Service in London which is believed to have exposed the names, photographs and ranks of the force’s 47,000 personnel. Rick Prior, the vice chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation — the policing union representing more than 30,000 officers — said that incident would cause “incredible concern and anger” among officers. “We share that sense of fury,” he added. “This is a staggering security breach. We will be holding the Metropolitan Police to account for what has happened.”News BriefsCybercrime NewsGovernment NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsUnited KingdomPolicedata breachNo previous articleNo new articlesAlexander Martinis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "CISA panel pitches idea of a National Cybersecurity Alert SystemLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Philip Oroni via UnsplashJonathan GreigSeptember 14th, 2023CISA panel pitches idea of a National Cybersecurity Alert SystemThe U.S. needs a national cybersecurity alert system that would provide actionable information on threats and risks, according to a panel that advises the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Without specifying what such a system would look like or how it would behave, the panel found that “there is a genuine need for a national cybersecurity alert system that routinizes the 24/7 consideration and provisioning of cyber alerts.” The Cybersecurity Advisory Committee (CSAC), led by former National Cyber Director Chris Inglis, created a subcommittee in March to investigate the prospect of a National Cybersecurity Alert System. The panel released its findings Wednesday at the CSAC’s virtual meeting, the third this year. CISA wanted Inglis and his team to gain an understanding of the appetite for a system that would convey the current severity of national cybersecurity risk — either through a numerical scoring system or a color-coded method akin to the controversial Homeland Security Advisory System created after the 9/11 attacks. CISA already provides a range of alerts, advisories, and bulletins about specific threats, but these do not provide an understanding of shifts in the types of threats or an understanding of national cyber risk, the panel found. Inglis said the current array of reports are “not authoritative, not necessarily coherent, and they're not curated in some singular fashion over time.” As part of its work, the panel spoke with cybersecurity officials in Israel and Canada as well as at several U.S. agencies. “We do think there's a genuine need for actionable, granular kind of information that constitutes an alert system that is actually curated over time so that we know if we go shields up, we know why we've done that and we know when to bring those shields down to some degree so that we can actually target this for the circumstances,” Inglis said. The subcommittee determined that CISA would be the right organization to create the alert system, but the agency would face challenges in the process, Inglis said. But they explained in their report that CISA “currently lacks analytical capacity and unique, value-added data sources to be able to reliably field a national cybersecurity alert system.” When it originally asked the experts to look into the idea, CISA referenced the 2022 “Shields Up” program that was started after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an example of the kind of “specific, time-delimited” warnings that provided value. The agency notified organizations that threats are significant and imminent and that defenders should lower their threshold for sharing information now.” The campaign also saw CISA provide more general long-term cybersecurity guidance about patching, multi-factor authentication, segmentation and more. Several organizations told Inglis and others that there was real value in the information provided through the Shields Up effort. CIRCIA and the SEC Inglis noted that this may be the ideal time to create a national alert system as CISA organizes rules outlined in the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act — which CISA officials refer to by its acronym CIRCIA. The watershed law will force critical infrastructure organizations to report significant cyber incidents. Several other committee members mentioned the new incident reporting rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as another tool that may serve as a backdrop for the alert system. Inglis explained that an alert system would be helped not only by the information that comes into government agencies due to the new rules, but also by organizations’ newfound need to collect this kind of data on threats. “These should be resources, not just for kind of responding to an SEC mandate, but frankly, for increasingly a self-imposed mandate that companies, whether they're private or public to actually deal with cyber risk. How do we characterize it? How do we actually understand when it's on the rise? How do we actually marry that with information so that we can then meaningfully do something about that?” he said. “This should actually provide tools so that when those folks respond, whether it's within a CIRCIA framework, whether it's an SEC framework, they have more granularity, they have more information and more authoritativeness associated with both of those, so that they can deal with it. I think that's the benefit here.” CISA Director Jen Easterly said the CIRCIA and SEC rules would actually make the alert system better so that the government can actually determine — and share — when certain attacks like ransomware are increasing or decreasing. But Easterly noted that the SEC reporting rule will be different from CIRCIA because it “will be richer in terms of informing things like TTPs and enabling us to better scope wherever the alert system lands.” Inglis also noted that the alert system would be distinct from the SEC rules, which have faced stiff backlash in recent weeks. While the SEC rules are meant to inform investors, the alert system’s goal would be attending to cyber resilience and making underlying digital infrastructure more robust. “I think that that is a more focused task that is at the heart of the national cyber alert system. Let's double down to make sure that the digital infrastructure meets our expectations so that we can have confidence it will do what we want it to do,” he said. The subcommittee urged CISA to meet with stakeholders to figure out what kind of actionable or curated information would be valuable to organizations and to coordinate with other agencies that would be able to participate. Subcommittee members believe the alerts should operate in a tiered model, where certain alerts are not public and are only given to those who need it, Inglis said. He hammered home that the term “actionable” needs to be “atomically bound” to the idea of alerts so that the government is not simply producing another color warning system that can be ignored. New leadership Inglis took over the project from Tom Fanning, executive chairman of Southern Company and chair of CSAC, who will be departing the committee at the end of his two-year term in November. Ron Green and Dave DeWalt were elected as the new chair and vice chair respectively. Other members of the subcommittee included Kevin Mandia of Mandiant, DefCon and Black Hat founder Jeff Moss and Obama administration cybersecurity official Suzanne Spaulding. CSAC was created in 2021 to provide recommendations to Easterly and CISA, and this was their third meeting of 2023. Alongside the recommendations for a national alert system, several subcommittees provided ideas about corporate cyber responsibility, cyber-hygiene efforts, critical infrastructure, attacks on high-risk communities and the cyber workforce. The next meeting will take place in-person in December.Government NewsNewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.Tagsincident responseCISAregulationChris InglisNo previous articleNo new articlesJonathan Greigis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

The International Joint Commission (IJC) — guided by the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty signed by both countries — approves projects that affect the water levels and flows across the border, investigates transboundary issues and offers solutions. On Monday, the NoEscape ransomware gang claimed it attacked the organization — which has offices in Washington, D.C., Ottawa and Windsor — and stole 80 GB of contracts, geological files, conflict of interest forms and more. #NoEscape has listed the International Joint Commission. #ransomware 1/3 pic.twitter.com/MCQzSCbmUS— Brett Callow (@BrettCallow) September 11, 2023 The gang gave the IJC 10 days to respond to their demand for a ransom. The group did not say how much money it was demanding to unlock the files. On Wednesday, an ICJ spokesperson confirmed that it was dealing with a cybersecurity issue but declined to elaborate about whether law enforcement has been contacted or if the organization was facing operational issues. “The International Joint Commission has experienced a cyber security incident,” a spokesperson said. “The organization is taking measures to investigate and resolve the situation.” They did not respond to requests for comment about whether a ransom would be paid. Since emerging in May, NoEscape hackers have taken credit for attacks on Germany’s bar association and Hawaiʻi Community College as well as Australian companies, a hospital in Belgium, a manufacturing company in the US and another manufacturing company in the Netherlands. Organizations like the International Joint Commission and others centered around managing or legislating water systems have become a battleground for cybersecurity regulation this year. State lawmakers and federal regulators are currently in court over rules passed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March that add cybersecurity to annual state audits of public water systems. This week, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announced that it would be offering drinking water and wastewater systems free vulnerability scanning services. Water systems can get weekly automated scans that will provide a report on known vulnerabilities found on internet-accessible assets, week-to-week comparisons, and mitigations. “Drinking water and wastewater systems are vital for our community’s wellbeing,” CISA said. “But they’re not immune to cyberattacks.”News BriefsCybercrime NewsGovernment NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsWaterwater utilityUSACanadaNo previous articleNo new articlesJonathan Greigis a Breaking News Reporter at Recorded Future News.

against the aerospace, aviation and defense industries in the Middle East appears to have links to Iran, security researchers say.\\\\n\\\\nThe operation is targeting entities in Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — and potentially Turkey, India and Albania — [according to analysts at Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east), the cybersecurity unit for Google Cloud.\\\\n\\\\nThe campaign began as early as June 2022, and appears to be linked to an Iranian group that Mandiant tracks as UNC1549, which overlaps with another hacking operation labeled Tortoiseshell.\\\\n\\\\nThat group’s hit list has included [Israeli shipping companies](https://therecord.media/israel-shipping-logistics-watering-hole-cyberattacks) and [U.S. aerospace and defense companies](https://therecord.media/facebook-disrupts-iranian-group-targeting-us-defense-and-aerospace-sectors), and reports have connected it to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Earlier this month, the U.S. [sanctioned](https://therecord.media/sanctions-iran-hackers-us-water-utilities-attacks) members of an IRGC unit for attacks against water utilities. \\\\n\\\\nThe researchers said the potential IRGC connection “is noteworthy given the focus on defense-related entities and the recent tensions with Iran in light of the Israel-Hamas war.” Iran openly supports the Hamas militants in Gaza.\\\\n\\\\nMandiant observed UNC1549 “deploy multiple evasion techniques to mask their activity, most prominently the extensive use of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure as well as social engineering schemes to disseminate two unique backdoors: MINIBIKE and MINIBUS.”\\\\n\\\\nThe MINIBIKE malware was first spotted in June 2022 and last seen in October 2023. It’s capable of “file exfiltration and upload, command execution, and more,” Mandiant said, and it uses Azure cloud infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\nMINIBUS, meanwhile, is a “custom backdoor that provides a more flexible code-execution interface and enhanced reconnaissance features,” the researchers said. They first spotted it in August 2023 and saw it as recently as January.\\\\n\\\\nThe two pieces of malware cover the usual cyber-espionage checklist, including the harvesting of login credentials to enable further spying, or running other malicious code to clear the way for more activity. \\\\n\\\\nThe researchers also spotted a custom “tunneler” they labeled LIGHTRAIL. Tunnelers essentially hide malicious activity by [wrapping](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-tunneling/) internet traffic inside other traffic.\",\"isBrief\":true,\"createdAt\":\"2024-02-28T20:29:56.073Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2024-02-28T20:45:32.926Z\",\"publishedAt\":\"2024-02-28T20:30:06.186Z\",\"showFrom\":null,\"listingShowFrom\":null,\"editor\":{\"data\":{\"id\":23,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Joe Warminsky\",\"bio\":\"is the news editor for Recorded Future News.

While Ukraine has labeled Maidan-3 as the most expensive campaign by Russian intelligence, there\\'s no independent research to confirm this.\\\\n\\\\nAs part of its large-scale disinformation operation, Russia is attempting to undermine trust between Ukrainian citizens, the country’s military and Western allies, GUR said. Russia is also using its spies in Ukraine and other countries to discredit the process of exchanging prisoners of war and organize various protests around the world.\\\\n\\\\nDuring mass protests by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports earlier in February, some of the farmers brought the Soviet Union flag and a pro-Russian poster urging Putin to \\\\\"bring order to Ukraine, Brussels, and Polish government officials.\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThere is no clear evidence that Russia was involved in inciting this protest, but Poland\\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has [called](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/02/21/7442926/) on its citizens to distance themselves from such narratives, as they harm the country\\'s reputation.\\\\n\\\\n“We are convinced that this is an attempt to ‘hijack’ the farmers\\' protest movement by radical and irresponsible groups, possibly under the influence of Russian agents,” the ministry said.\\\\n\\\\nFrench foreign ministry officials also [warned](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240213-france-accuses-russia-of-disinformation-campaign-against-ukraine-s-allies) earlier that Russia has escalated its disinformation efforts in Poland, Germany and France.

The threat is now. And the threat is deeper and broader than you might think,” said Mike Burgess, delivering the agency’s [annual threat assessment](https://www.asio.gov.au/director-generals-annual-threat-assessment-2024) on Wednesday evening.\\\\n\\\\nThe director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said there was a “a particular team in a particular foreign intelligence service with a particular focus on Australia – we are its priority target.” Although he did not name the nation state or provide any details about their tactics, he called the threat group “the A-team.”\\\\n\\\\nThe name wasn’t intended to be a compliment, said Burgess, warning that several years ago the A-team “successfully cultivated and recruited a former Australian politician. This politician sold out their country, party and former colleagues to advance the interests of the foreign regime.”\\\\n\\\\nThis politician, who went unnamed, had proposed attempting to bring a family member of the then-Australian prime minister into contact with the foreign intelligence service, although this plot did not go ahead.\\\\n\\\\nIn another scenario disclosed by Burgess, some of Australia’s leading academics and political figures were invited to attend an all-expenses paid overseas conference to meet the foreign country’s bureaucrats.\\\\n\\\\nIn reality, the conference was a front for the spies to build relationships with the attendees — only some of whom did not realize they were working for the foreign power. According to Burgess, the spies bluntly asked the attendees who of them had access to government documents.\\\\n\\\\n“We helped the unaware ones extract themselves, and severed the links between the others and the foreign intelligence service. Several individuals should be grateful the espionage and foreign interference laws are not retrospective,” added Burgess, referencing laws that were passed in 2018.\\\\n\\\\n# Spy vs. spy\\\\n\\\\nHe said ASIO had contacted the A-team directly, tricking its leader last year into thinking he was grooming an Australian online when in fact he was speaking to an ASIO officer.\\\\n\\\\n“The spy was being spied on, the player was being played. You can imagine his horror when my officer revealed himself and declared, ‘We know who you are. We know what you are doing. Stop it or there will be further consequences.’”\\\\n\\\\nBut old-fashioned human intelligence is just one of the threats facing Australia, said Burgess: “The most immediate, low-cost and potentially high-impact vector for sabotage is cyber. Our critical infrastructure networks are interconnected and interdependent, which increases the vulnerabilities and potential access points.”\\\\n\\\\nHe said ASIO was aware of one nation state, which he did not identify, scanning critical infrastructure in Australia and other countries — particularly targeting water, transport and energy networks — using “highly sophisticated … top-notch tradecraft to map networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks.”\\\\n\\\\nHis comments align with a description of Chinese government activity that Australia’ cybersecurity directorate, alongside its Five Eyes allies, [attributed to Volt Typhoon](https://therecord.media/cisa-fbi-warn-of-china-linked-hackers-targeting-critical-us-infrastructure), the hacking group that has caused alarm at the senior-most levels of government over the last year.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking a week after the advisory was published, Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, [warned](https://therecord.media/volt-typhoon-china-defining-espionage-pre-positioning-neuberger-munich): “We know it is not for espionage purposes, because when we look at the sectors like water sectors and civilian airport sectors, those have very little intelligence value.”\\\\n\\\\n“We assess this government is not actively planning sabotage, but is trying to gain persistent undetected access that could allow it to conduct sabotage in the future,” said Burgess. “I’m not sure the potential harm is widely understood.”\\\\n\\\\nTake security more seriously, the director general urged: “Develop a robust security culture. Do not make yourself an easy target. Report suspicious approaches. This is a national challenge that needs a national team to meet it. Every Australian can help keep Australia safe.”\",\"isBrief\":false,\"createdAt\":\"2024-02-28T16:48:24.536Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2024-02-28T18:13:22.171Z\",\"publishedAt\":\"2024-02-28T16:48:26.059Z\",\"showFrom\":null,\"listingShowFrom\":null,\"editor\":{\"data\":{\"id\":33,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Alexander Martin\",\"bio\":\"is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

Iranian cyber-espionage campaign targets Middle East aerospace, defense industries\",\"date\":\"2024-02-28T20:29:56.073Z\",\"body\":\"An ongoing cyber-espionage campaign that uses unique malware against the aerospace, aviation and defense industries in the Middle East appears to have links to Iran, security researchers say.\\n\\nThe operation is targeting entities in Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — and potentially Turkey, India and Albania — [according to analysts at Mandiant](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east), the cybersecurity unit for Google Cloud.\\n\\nThe campaign began as early as June 2022, and appears to be linked to an Iranian group that Mandiant tracks as UNC1549, which overlaps with another hacking operation labeled Tortoiseshell.\\n\\nThat group’s hit list has included [Israeli shipping companies](https://therecord.media/israel-shipping-logistics-watering-hole-cyberattacks) and [U.S. aerospace and defense companies](https://therecord.media/facebook-disrupts-iranian-group-targeting-us-defense-and-aerospace-sectors), and reports have connected it to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Earlier this month, the U.S. [sanctioned](https://therecord.media/sanctions-iran-hackers-us-water-utilities-attacks) members of an IRGC unit for attacks against water utilities. \\n\\nThe researchers said the potential IRGC connection “is noteworthy given the focus on defense-related entities and the recent tensions with Iran in light of the Israel-Hamas war.” Iran openly supports the Hamas militants in Gaza.\\n\\nMandiant observed UNC1549 “deploy multiple evasion techniques to mask their activity, most prominently the extensive use of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure as well as social engineering schemes to disseminate two unique backdoors: MINIBIKE and MINIBUS.”\\n\\nThe MINIBIKE malware was first spotted in June 2022 and last seen in October 2023. It’s capable of “file exfiltration and upload, command execution, and more,” Mandiant said, and it uses Azure cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nMINIBUS, meanwhile, is a “custom backdoor that provides a more flexible code-execution interface and enhanced reconnaissance features,” the researchers said. They first spotted it in August 2023 and saw it as recently as January.\\n\\nThe two pieces of malware cover the usual cyber-espionage checklist, including the harvesting of login credentials to enable further spying, or running other malicious code to clear the way for more activity. \\n\\nThe researchers also spotted a custom “tunneler” they labeled LIGHTRAIL. Tunnelers essentially hide malicious activity by [wrapping](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-tunneling/) internet traffic inside other traffic.\",\"isBrief\":true,\"createdAt\":\"2024-02-28T20:29:56.073Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2024-02-28T20:45:32.926Z\",\"publishedAt\":\"2024-02-28T20:30:06.186Z\",\"showFrom\":null,\"listingShowFrom\":null,\"editor\":{\"data\":{\"id\":23,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Joe Warminsky\",\"bio\":\"is the news editor for Recorded Future News.

While Ukraine has labeled Maidan-3 as the most expensive campaign by Russian intelligence, there's no independent research to confirm this.\\n\\nAs part of its large-scale disinformation operation, Russia is attempting to undermine trust between Ukrainian citizens, the country’s military and Western allies, GUR said. Russia is also using its spies in Ukraine and other countries to discredit the process of exchanging prisoners of war and organize various protests around the world.\\n\\nDuring mass protests by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports earlier in February, some of the farmers brought the Soviet Union flag and a pro-Russian poster urging Putin to \\\"bring order to Ukraine, Brussels, and Polish government officials.\\\"\\n\\nThere is no clear evidence that Russia was involved in inciting this protest, but Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has [called](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2024/02/21/7442926/) on its citizens to distance themselves from such narratives, as they harm the country's reputation.\\n\\n“We are convinced that this is an attempt to ‘hijack’ the farmers' protest movement by radical and irresponsible groups, possibly under the influence of Russian agents,” the ministry said.\\n\\nFrench foreign ministry officials also [warned](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240213-france-accuses-russia-of-disinformation-campaign-against-ukraine-s-allies) earlier that Russia has escalated its disinformation efforts in Poland, Germany and France.

The threat is now. And the threat is deeper and broader than you might think,” said Mike Burgess, delivering the agency’s [annual threat assessment](https://www.asio.gov.au/director-generals-annual-threat-assessment-2024) on Wednesday evening.\\n\\nThe director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said there was a “a particular team in a particular foreign intelligence service with a particular focus on Australia – we are its priority target.” Although he did not name the nation state or provide any details about their tactics, he called the threat group “the A-team.”\\n\\nThe name wasn’t intended to be a compliment, said Burgess, warning that several years ago the A-team “successfully cultivated and recruited a former Australian politician. This politician sold out their country, party and former colleagues to advance the interests of the foreign regime.”\\n\\nThis politician, who went unnamed, had proposed attempting to bring a family member of the then-Australian prime minister into contact with the foreign intelligence service, although this plot did not go ahead.\\n\\nIn another scenario disclosed by Burgess, some of Australia’s leading academics and political figures were invited to attend an all-expenses paid overseas conference to meet the foreign country’s bureaucrats.\\n\\nIn reality, the conference was a front for the spies to build relationships with the attendees — only some of whom did not realize they were working for the foreign power. According to Burgess, the spies bluntly asked the attendees who of them had access to government documents.\\n\\n“We helped the unaware ones extract themselves, and severed the links between the others and the foreign intelligence service. Several individuals should be grateful the espionage and foreign interference laws are not retrospective,” added Burgess, referencing laws that were passed in 2018.\\n\\n# Spy vs. spy\\n\\nHe said ASIO had contacted the A-team directly, tricking its leader last year into thinking he was grooming an Australian online when in fact he was speaking to an ASIO officer.\\n\\n“The spy was being spied on, the player was being played. You can imagine his horror when my officer revealed himself and declared, ‘We know who you are. We know what you are doing. Stop it or there will be further consequences.’”\\n\\nBut old-fashioned human intelligence is just one of the threats facing Australia, said Burgess: “The most immediate, low-cost and potentially high-impact vector for sabotage is cyber. Our critical infrastructure networks are interconnected and interdependent, which increases the vulnerabilities and potential access points.”\\n\\nHe said ASIO was aware of one nation state, which he did not identify, scanning critical infrastructure in Australia and other countries — particularly targeting water, transport and energy networks — using “highly sophisticated … top-notch tradecraft to map networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks.”\\n\\nHis comments align with a description of Chinese government activity that Australia’ cybersecurity directorate, alongside its Five Eyes allies, [attributed to Volt Typhoon](https://therecord.media/cisa-fbi-warn-of-china-linked-hackers-targeting-critical-us-infrastructure), the hacking group that has caused alarm at the senior-most levels of government over the last year.\\n\\nSpeaking a week after the advisory was published, Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, [warned](https://therecord.media/volt-typhoon-china-defining-espionage-pre-positioning-neuberger-munich): “We know it is not for espionage purposes, because when we look at the sectors like water sectors and civilian airport sectors, those have very little intelligence value.”\\n\\n“We assess this government is not actively planning sabotage, but is trying to gain persistent undetected access that could allow it to conduct sabotage in the future,” said Burgess. “I’m not sure the potential harm is widely understood.”\\n\\nTake security more seriously, the director general urged: “Develop a robust security culture. Do not make yourself an easy target. Report suspicious approaches. This is a national challenge that needs a national team to meet it. Every Australian can help keep Australia safe.”\",\"isBrief\":false,\"createdAt\":\"2024-02-28T16:48:24.536Z\",\"updatedAt\":\"2024-02-28T18:13:22.171Z\",\"publishedAt\":\"2024-02-28T16:48:26.059Z\",\"showFrom\":null,\"listingShowFrom\":null,\"editor\":{\"data\":{\"id\":33,\"attributes\":{\"name\":\"Alexander Martin\",\"bio\":\"is the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Suspected Iranian cyber-espionage campaign targets Middle East aerospace, defense industriesLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Bruno Mira via UnsplashJoe WarminskyFebruary 28th, 2024Suspected Iranian cyber-espionage campaign targets Middle East aerospace, defense industriesAn ongoing cyber-espionage campaign that uses unique malware against the aerospace, aviation and defense industries in the Middle East appears to have links to Iran, security researchers say. The operation is targeting entities in Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — and potentially Turkey, India and Albania — according to analysts at Mandiant, the cybersecurity unit for Google Cloud. The campaign began as early as June 2022, and appears to be linked to an Iranian group that Mandiant tracks as UNC1549, which overlaps with another hacking operation labeled Tortoiseshell. That group’s hit list has included Israeli shipping companies and U.S. aerospace and defense companies, and reports have connected it to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Earlier this month, the U.S. sanctioned members of an IRGC unit for attacks against water utilities. The researchers said the potential IRGC connection “is noteworthy given the focus on defense-related entities and the recent tensions with Iran in light of the Israel-Hamas war.” Iran openly supports the Hamas militants in Gaza. Mandiant observed UNC1549 “deploy multiple evasion techniques to mask their activity, most prominently the extensive use of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure as well as social engineering schemes to disseminate two unique backdoors: MINIBIKE and MINIBUS.” The MINIBIKE malware was first spotted in June 2022 and last seen in October 2023. It’s capable of “file exfiltration and upload, command execution, and more,” Mandiant said, and it uses Azure cloud infrastructure. MINIBUS, meanwhile, is a “custom backdoor that provides a more flexible code-execution interface and enhanced reconnaissance features,” the researchers said. They first spotted it in August 2023 and saw it as recently as January. The two pieces of malware cover the usual cyber-espionage checklist, including the harvesting of login credentials to enable further spying, or running other malicious code to clear the way for more activity. The researchers also spotted a custom “tunneler” they labeled LIGHTRAIL. Tunnelers essentially hide malicious activity by wrapping internet traffic inside other traffic.Cybercrime NewsNewsNation-state NewsMalware NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsIranMandiantaerospacedefenseIsraelMiddle Eastcyber-espionageNo previous articleNo new articlesJoe Warminskyis the news editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Ukraine expects billion-dollar Russian disinformation campaign to peak this springLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Unsplash/PhotomoshDaryna AntoniukFebruary 28th, 2024Ukraine expects billion-dollar Russian disinformation campaign to peak this springUkraine's military intelligence unit warned that Russia has poured more than $1 billion into an ongoing disinformation campaign aimed to diminish Western support for Kyiv and sow panic and distrust among Ukrainian citizens. The campaign called “Maidan-3” was launched by Russia last November but is expected to peak between March and May, Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (GUR) said in a statement on Tuesday. “In the coming weeks, the enemy will make every effort to spread narratives destructive to global security and attempt to incite conflicts — both inside Ukraine and in other parts of the world where Ukraine has effective support,\" the agency said. Russia's strategy with this campaign, according to GUR, is to destabilize the country and then, taking advantage of the situation, inflict damage on the Ukrainian military on the eastern frontlines. Ukraine said it estimated that Russia has spent $250 million to spread anti-Ukrainian narratives on the messaging app Telegram, with the whole campaign costing about $1.5 billion. While Ukraine has labeled Maidan-3 as the most expensive campaign by Russian intelligence, there's no independent research to confirm this. As part of its large-scale disinformation operation, Russia is attempting to undermine trust between Ukrainian citizens, the country’s military and Western allies, GUR said. Russia is also using its spies in Ukraine and other countries to discredit the process of exchanging prisoners of war and organize various protests around the world. During mass protests by Polish farmers against Ukrainian agricultural imports earlier in February, some of the farmers brought the Soviet Union flag and a pro-Russian poster urging Putin to \"bring order to Ukraine, Brussels, and Polish government officials.\" There is no clear evidence that Russia was involved in inciting this protest, but Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on its citizens to distance themselves from such narratives, as they harm the country's reputation. “We are convinced that this is an attempt to ‘hijack’ the farmers' protest movement by radical and irresponsible groups, possibly under the influence of Russian agents,” the ministry said. French foreign ministry officials also warned earlier that Russia has escalated its disinformation efforts in Poland, Germany and France. The Kremlin's goal with these campaigns is to amplify Russia's perceived success in the war in Ukraine, justify its invasion, discredit Ukraine's military and undermine Western support for Ukraine, including the supply of weapons to Kyiv. Ukraine's intelligence said that Russian special services have “extensive experience” in conducting hybrid wars. “They spend no less on information attacks against Ukraine than on a conventional war,” GUR said. Ukraine has urged its Western partners and its own citizens to resist the spread of Russian disinformation and enhance their security measures to “effectively counter the challenges posed by a new world hybrid war.” Over the last two months, Ukraine has signed four security agreements with its Western allies aiming, among other things, to counter Russian cyberattacks and propaganda.

      "Australia facing its highest-ever threat from espionage and foreign interferenceLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Joey Csunyo via UnsplashAlexander MartinFebruary 28th, 2024Australia facing its highest-ever threat from espionage and foreign interferenceMore Australians are “being targeted for espionage and foreign interference than ever before,” the head of the country’s domestic security agency has warned. “Australians need to know that the threat is real. The threat is now. And the threat is deeper and broader than you might think,” said Mike Burgess, delivering the agency’s annual threat assessment on Wednesday evening. The director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) said there was a “a particular team in a particular foreign intelligence service with a particular focus on Australia – we are its priority target.” Although he did not name the nation state or provide any details about their tactics, he called the threat group “the A-team.” The name wasn’t intended to be a compliment, said Burgess, warning that several years ago the A-team “successfully cultivated and recruited a former Australian politician. This politician sold out their country, party and former colleagues to advance the interests of the foreign regime.” This politician, who went unnamed, had proposed attempting to bring a family member of the then-Australian prime minister into contact with the foreign intelligence service, although this plot did not go ahead. In another scenario disclosed by Burgess, some of Australia’s leading academics and political figures were invited to attend an all-expenses paid overseas conference to meet the foreign country’s bureaucrats. In reality, the conference was a front for the spies to build relationships with the attendees — only some of whom did not realize they were working for the foreign power. According to Burgess, the spies bluntly asked the attendees who of them had access to government documents. “We helped the unaware ones extract themselves, and severed the links between the others and the foreign intelligence service. Several individuals should be grateful the espionage and foreign interference laws are not retrospective,” added Burgess, referencing laws that were passed in 2018. Spy vs. spy He said ASIO had contacted the A-team directly, tricking its leader last year into thinking he was grooming an Australian online when in fact he was speaking to an ASIO officer. “The spy was being spied on, the player was being played. You can imagine his horror when my officer revealed himself and declared, ‘We know who you are. We know what you are doing. Stop it or there will be further consequences.’” But old-fashioned human intelligence is just one of the threats facing Australia, said Burgess: “The most immediate, low-cost and potentially high-impact vector for sabotage is cyber. Our critical infrastructure networks are interconnected and interdependent, which increases the vulnerabilities and potential access points.” He said ASIO was aware of one nation state, which he did not identify, scanning critical infrastructure in Australia and other countries — particularly targeting water, transport and energy networks — using “highly sophisticated … top-notch tradecraft to map networks, test for vulnerabilities, knock on digital doors and check the digital locks.” His comments align with a description of Chinese government activity that Australia’ cybersecurity directorate, alongside its Five Eyes allies, attributed to Volt Typhoon, the hacking group that has caused alarm at the senior-most levels of government over the last year. Speaking a week after the advisory was published, Anne Neuberger, the White House’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, warned: “We know it is not for espionage purposes, because when we look at the sectors like water sectors and civilian airport sectors, those have very little intelligence value.” “We assess this government is not actively planning sabotage, but is trying to gain persistent undetected access that could allow it to conduct sabotage in the future,” said Burgess. “I’m not sure the potential harm is widely understood.” Take security more seriously, the director general urged: “Develop a robust security culture. Do not make yourself an easy target. Report suspicious approaches. This is a national challenge that needs a national team to meet it. Every Australian can help keep Australia safe.”China NewsGovernment NewsLeadership NewsNation-state NewsNewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsAustraliaVolt TyphoonChinaAustralian Cyber Security CentreCritical Infrastructurecyber-espionageintelligence agencyNo previous articleNo new articlesAlexander Martinis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Senator asks FTC to investigate automakers’ data privacy practicesLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Unsplash/PhotomoshSuzanne SmalleyFebruary 28th, 2024Senator asks FTC to investigate automakers’ data privacy practicesCalling automakers’ responses to his demand for answers “evasive and vague,” Sen. Edward Markey (D-MA) on Wednesday called on Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Chair Lina Khan to investigate the car industry’s data privacy practices. In a letter to Khan, Markey said in December he asked 14 major car manufacturers to offer transparency on how they implement and enforce privacy protections in their vehicles. Markey told Khan that the answers he received were far from clear and even prevaricating. Car manufacturers “sidestepped my questions or focused on the beneficial uses of this data — all while ignoring the real privacy risks their data practices create,” Markey wrote to Khan. As an example, he said most of the surveyed 14 car manufacturers refused to tell him whether they transfer data for commercial benefit. Although the manufacturers all said they give consumers the opportunity to consent to having their data collected, just one provided the percentage of consumers that actually give consent, Markey told Khan. Most automakers surveyed acknowledged they only provide the right to delete data to consumers in states where the automaker is legally required to do so, the senator said. Markey also told Khan that the manufacturers “largely failed to answer whether they collect more data than is needed for the service provided, whether a consumer loses certain vehicle functionality by refusing to consent to the data collection, or whether the manufacturers have suffered a cyberattack in the last ten years.” “These responses raise far more questions than answers,” he added. Automakers’ responses to Markey were in some cases skimpy and imprecise and in other cases robust but heavily caveated and carefully worded. Still, common themes emerged, with automakers nearly across the board acknowledging they gather location data and 12 of 14 acknowledging they share car owners’ activities with law enforcement when asked. Markey noted that those twelve said they typically provide data to law enforcement only in response to a subpoena, warrant or other legal order. Not all car manufacturers were precise on the point, however. Nissan’s response noted it turns data over to law enforcement when faced with “valid compulsory process,” which car privacy experts said could mean anything. Markey urged Khan to act now, saying the industry has been operating with little or no oversight for years even as stalkers have been able to exploit location data to harass victims and many Americans have increasingly demanded answers on how car manufacturers treat and monetize their private data. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) also announced it is increasing its scrutiny of connected cars Wednesday, saying that a new proposed rulemaking will seek input on the types and frequency of use of connected car services. According to an FCC press release, the proposal is seeking insights into what steps “connected car service providers can proactively take to protect survivors from the misuse of connected car services.”Government NewsNewsTechnology NewsPrivacy NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.Tagsautomotive industryautomobilesSenatedata privacyLina KhanFTCFCCNo previous articleNo new articlesSuzanne Smalleyis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

      "Irish foreign affairs ministry says ‘no evidence’ of cyber breach following extortion claimLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterIveagh House, Dublin, the headquarters of Ireland's Department of Foreign Affairs. Image: DFAAlexander MartinFebruary 28th, 2024Irish foreign affairs ministry says ‘no evidence’ of cyber breach following extortion claimIreland’s Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said there was currently “no evidence of any breach” of its IT systems following a claim by a new cyber extortion group that it had stolen data and was prepared to sell it. The new group, calling itself Mogilevich, listed the DFA on Tuesday, claiming to offer 7GB of compromised documents for sale. The group did not provide any evidence supporting its claims of having breached the department. Three other victims are listed on Mogilevich’s extortion site. Recorded Future News is not publishing their names as these companies have not responded to requests for comment. The group provided no evidence for the other breaches, which are also unsupported by any public evidence. In a statement, a spokesperson for the DFA said the department was “notified by Ireland’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) on Tuesday evening (27 February) of a potential cybersecurity incident.” They added that the DFA “has been working closely with the NCSC to establish whether this allegation is authentic.” So far, they said “there is no evidence of any breach of DFA ICT security infrastructure. The Department, in conjunction with the NCSC, will continue its investigation and, should any breach be identified, will address any issues that arise around information held by the Department.” There are a number of indications that the Mogilevich group is inauthentic. Unlike the extortion sites used by established ransomware-as-a-service groups, Mogilevich’s site is amateurishly designed. The group also requests a $1,000 deposit from potential affiliates — something likely to provoke enormous suspicion among professional fraudsters. Fraudulent ransomware gangs are an established occurrence in the cybercrime world. Back in 2019, cybersecurity company Coveware named the phenomenon “Phantom Incident Extortion” in a report detailing the scam. Such scammers are the bottom-feeders of the ransomware world, lacking both the capabilities to gain initial access to a victim’s network and then the platform to monetise that access — despite how significantly the cybercriminal ecosystem has lowered the bar for both.Government NewsCybercrime NewsNewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsIrelandextortionNo previous articleNo new articlesAlexander Martinis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Pharmaceutical giant Cencora reports cyberattackLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterJoe WarminskyFebruary 28th, 2024Pharmaceutical giant Cencora reports cyberattackGlobal pharmaceutical corporation Cencora reported on Tuesday that it recently discovered that intruders had stolen data from its networks. The Fortune 500 company said in a regulatory filing that data from IT systems “had been exfiltrated” in an incident that came to light on February 21. “Upon initial detection of the unauthorized activity, the Company immediately took containment steps and commenced an investigation with the assistance of law enforcement, cybersecurity experts and external counsel,” Cencora said in an 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The event “has not had a material impact on the Company’s operations,” Cencora said. Formerly known as AmerisourceBergen, the Pennsylvania-based corporation has 46,000 employees and reported revenue of $262.2 billion for fiscal 2023. The regulatory filing did not specify the nature of the intrusion. Several pharmaceutical companies have been hit by cybercriminals in recent months — an attack announced by Change Healthcare last week has resulted in disruptions for pharmacies nationwide. Last year, Japanese pharmaceutical giant Eisai said some of its servers were encrypted by a ransomware group, and India’s Sun Pharmaceuticals stole company data and personal information.Cybercrime NewsNewsNews BriefsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsHealthcarePharmaceuticalChange HealthcareCencoraNo previous articleNo new articlesJoe Warminskyis the news editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Biden order will limit how much data can be sold to Russia and ChinaLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: The White House / FlickrSuzanne SmalleyFebruary 28th, 2024Biden order will limit how much data can be sold to Russia and ChinaData brokers and other companies peddling Americans’ personal information to hostile countries such as Russia and China are now in the crosshairs of the Biden administration, which on Wednesday will issue an unprecedented executive order limiting such transfers of Americans’ most sensitive personal data. The order seeks to protect Americans’ data from being exploited by adversarial countries and entities tied to them — China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and Cuba — for use in blackmail, fraud, surveillance and other violations. Under the order, the Justice Department will be able to bar what the administration referred to as the “large-scale” transfer of Americans’ private data. The focus is on genomic, biometric, personal health, geolocation and financial data, which a senior administration official told reporters is already being used for “malicious cyber-enabled activities,” espionage and blackmail, with military members, national security officials, journalists and dissidents among the most vulnerable. The White House said the order also recognizes that bulk data seized by adversarial countries could easily be used to train artificial intelligence models. In announcing the executive order, which will go through several layers of review, a Department of Justice official emphasized that the administration is focused on setting terms that do not block the free flow of data needed to conduct trade. “This rule, again, is very focused on specific thresholds of bulk data going to a specific and limited number of countries … and making sure that companies do prudent, responsible things when selling that data, when giving it to their employees or when giving it to those who invest in them,” the official said. The administration’s plan represents just the latest front in a digital battle between the U.S. and China, whose TikTok social media platform has come under fire for sucking up American data and allowing the spread of disinformation. For its part, China makes American tech platforms that sweep up vast quantities of data — such as Meta, Google and Snapchat — unavailable to its populace. “Hostile foreign powers are weaponizing bulk data and the power of artificial intelligence to target Americans,” Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen said in a statement. He added that the executive order will fill a “key gap in our national security authorities, affording the Justice Department a new and powerful enforcement tool to protect Americans and their most sensitive information from being exploited by our adversaries.” Biden’s order attacks a problem already well under way as a surging number of data brokers have indefinitely stored and proven willing to sell ever more granular information on Americans to anyone who wants to buy it. In November, Duke University researchers announced they had used .asia domain names tied to a server in Singapore to obtain vast amounts of data on American service members for 12 to 32 cents a record. The researchers said they also were able to buy data for people located in “geofenced” military compounds such as Quantico, Virginia. The new rules take on an exploding industry — data broker companies are used by small companies to market products and the raw trade in bulk private data is a vital tool for tech giants fueling highly profitable behavioral advertising. Recent Federal Trade Commission enforcement actions have exposed the inner workings of companies collecting, storing and selling Americans’ most personal information, including geolocation data, web browsing data and health data. One firm, BetterHelp, Inc, allegedly sold personal information on individuals’ mental health challenges to tech platforms including Facebook, Snapchat and Pinterest for behavioral advertising. Among the executive order’s additional provisions are requirements that: The Department of Justice establishes rules better protecting sensitive government-related data, including location data for government facilities and members of the military. The departments of Justice and Homeland Security collaborate in setting tough security standards to block adversarial countries from obtaining Americans’ data from sources other than data brokers, including data available via what the administration called “investment, vendor, and employment relationships.” The departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Veterans Affairs guarantee that federal contracts and grants are not used by hostile countries to gain access to sensitive health data, including through companies based in the U.S. The interagency Committee for the Assessment of Foreign Participation in the United States Telecommunications Services Sector weighs how U.S. citizens’ sensitive personal data is potentially threatened as it considers whether to grant submarine cable licenses.

The attack against the university — which has approximately 5,500 students and is based in Bavaria, close to the mountainous border with Austria — is the latest to affect the technical education sector in Germany. In a statement published Tuesday, the institution said: “Despite very high security precautions, the criminals managed to gain access to parts of the university’s IT infrastructure.” Access to several IT systems were blocked as a precaution, meaning the university cannot currently be reached by email, although the telephone system is still working. “All those responsible are currently working hard to stop the attack, the extent of which cannot yet be estimated,” stated Kempten, adding that it was not possible to say when the university’s IT systems and services would be running normally again. The attack follows a spate of ransomware incidents affecting German-speaking applied sciences universities last year. The Kaiserslautern University of Applied Sciences (HS Kaiserslautern) announced an incident last June, while in March the Vice Society ransomware group added the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg) to its leak site following an attack that the institution said took place late last year. In February the University of Zurich, Switzerland’s largest university, announced it was the target of a “serious cyberattack,” which a spokesperson described to The Record as “part of a current accumulation of attacks on educational and health institutions.” The week before, the Harz University of Applied Sciences in Saxony-Anhalt, Ruhr West University, and the EU/FH European University of Applied Sciences all announced being impacted by cyberattacks.

Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 38, is the latest Bulgarian national to be charged after having been arrested in February. Five fellow Bulgarians, Orlin Roussev, 46, Bizer Dzhambazov, 42, Katrin Ivanova, 32, Ivan Stoyanov, 32, and Vanya Gaberova, 29, were arrested last year. Cmdr. Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan Police Service’s counterterrorism command, said: “A sixth suspect was identified and arrested as a result of enquiries made following the previous five arrests in this investigation, and working with the Crown Prosecution Service, a charge has now been brought.” The five were previously charged in September with “conspiring to collect information intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy for a purpose prejudicial to the safety and interest of the state,” under Section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. During the five’s first court hearing, the prosecution explained they were accused of being part of “an organised network which had carried out surveillance and hostile action on behalf of Russia against specific targets, including for potential abductions,” as reported by Reuters. The alleged spy ring was operational between August 30, 2020, and February 8, 2023, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Also named but not charged by the CPS is Jan Marsalek, the fugitive Austrian businessman who had been the chief operating officer for Wirecard.

      "Intel agencies issue guidance to protect against Russian botnetLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterMartin MatishakFebruary 28th, 2024Intel agencies issue guidance to protect against Russian botnetU.S. and international authorities on Tuesday urged owners of routers used in a Russian botnet operation to ensure the devices cannot still be exploited by malicious actors. The additional warning came a week after a coordinated international action by the FBI and others disrupted a Russian GRU-led hacking campaign that infiltrated more than a thousand home and small business routers that were used to carry out cyber espionage around the globe. Dubbed Operation Dying Ember, it was first announced by FBI Director Christopher Wray in remarks at the Munich Security Conference. LISTEN: FBI Director Chris Wray sat down for a rare interview with the Click Here podcast to talk about Operation Dying Ember. It marked the latest effort by U.S. law enforcement, led by the bureau and the Justice Department, to combat digital criminal groups — including a similar action earlier this month that knocked off Chinese government-sponsored hackers from hundreds of home and small business routers that were allegedly used to target American infrastructure networks. \"With these operations, and many more like them, we've set our sights on all the elements that we know from experience make criminal organizations tick,\" Wray said in Munich. \"Because we don't just want to hit them: we want to hit them everywhere it hurts and put them down hard.\" Despite last week’s apparent success against the so-called “Moobot” botnet that infected routers, “owners of relevant devices should” take steps to “ensure the long-term success of the disruption effort and to identify and remediate any similar compromises,” authorities cautioned. In particular, they recommended owners conduct a hardware reset to “flush file systems of malicious” content; upgrade to the latest firmware; change default usernames and passwords; and enact firewall protections in order to “prevent the unwanted exposure of remote management services.”Government NewsNewsNation-state NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsRussiaFBINSAintelligence agencyGRUChristopher WrayNo previous articleNo new articlesMartin Matishakis the senior cybersecurity reporter for The Record.

      "FTC’s Khan warns tech industry that agency will strictly enforce AI data privacyLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterSuzanne SmalleyFebruary 27th, 2024FTC’s Khan warns tech industry that agency will strictly enforce AI data privacyArtificial intelligence tools will be vigorously regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), with an eye on consumer privacy, its Chair Lina Khan told an audience of tech executives and startup founders at a conference Tuesday. “We’re crafting easily administrable remedies with bright-line rules on the development, use and management of AI inputs,” Khan said during a speech. “That means making clear that some data, particularly peoples’ sensitive health data, geolocation data and browsing data is simply off limits for model training.” Khan said the agency’s enforcement actions will make clear that “there is no AI exemption” from existing laws. “Firms cannot use claims of innovation as cover for law breaking,” Khan added. Referring to how behavioral advertising has sometimes fueled companies’ abuse of private data, Khan said AI model training is “emerging as another feature that could further incentivize surveillance.” The agency is closely watching how companies notify consumers if they want to use data they have already collected in another capacity to train AI, Khan said, emphasizing that firms must “actively notify users of this change rather than quietly and retroactively rewriting their terms of service.” The FTC recently announced a string of settlements with companies it alleges improperly used consumers' health, geolocation and browsing data. Last week, the agency announced that Avast Limited will pay $16.5 million and no longer be permitted to sell or license web browsing data to advertisers after an investigation revealing the company and its subsidiaries allegedly peddled aggregated, re-identifiable browsing data to third parties on a massive scale, usually without alerting consumers. Two data brokers were penalized for selling geolocation data to advertisers last month with the FTC alleging the companies amassed and sold the data without adequately informing consumers or obtaining their consent. The settlements cracking down on the sale of geolocation data were unprecedented for the agency. Last March, in one of a string of health privacy settlements, the online counseling service BetterHelp, Inc. agreed to pay $7.8 million for allegedly sharing information about consumers’ mental health difficulties with third parties, including Facebook and Snapchat, for advertising purposes. Khan’s speech Tuesday reflected the increasingly aggressive FTC approach to regulating technology companies’ treatment of consumer privacy. “We're looking at how business models can create and drive incentives,” Khan said. “Our remedies are making clear that the drive to refine algorithms cannot come at the expense of people's privacy or security.”Government NewsIndustry NewsNewsTechnology NewsPrivacy NewsLeadership NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsFTCLina Khanartificial intelligence (AI)data privacyNo previous articleNo new articlesSuzanne Smalleyis a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

The attack on Lurie Children’s Hospital was announced earlier this month, when officials said they had been forced to take their entire network offline due to an unspecified “cybersecurity matter.” The Rhysida ransomware-as-a-service group — which emerged in May last year, and has previously disrupted 16 hospitals across the U.S. — has now listed Lurie on its darknet extortion site. The children’s hospital is one of the biggest pediatric healthcare organizations in the Midwest, serving 239,000 children each year and treating more children with cancer and blood disorders than any other hospital in the state of Illinois. Despite the cyberattack, the hospital remains “open and providing care to patients with as few disruptions as possible,” although some appointments and elective surgeries were canceled as a result of the incident. According to a statement on Lurie’s website last updated on February 22, work is ongoing to recover the hospital’s systems and the MyChart electronic records system is still down. Patients and their parents are informed that the hospital is using manual processes due to the cyber disruption, which is resulting in “longer wait times between the request and completion of prescription requests.” “As a reminder, please bring your printed insurance card to each appointment and also bring your child's medication bottles or a complete list of their current medications,” states Lurie’s website. The ransomware group behind the attack is attempting to sell data stolen from the institution for 60 bitcoins, equivalent to just over $3.4 million. Last August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published a warning about the Rhysida group, noting that it appeared to be increasing its attacks targeting the healthcare sector.Cybercrime NewsNews BriefsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsHealthcarehospitalchildrenChicagoIllinoisRansomwareRhysidaNo previous articleNo new articlesAlexander Martinis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Suspected Iranian cyber-espionage campaign targets Middle East aerospace, defense industriesLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Bruno Mira via UnsplashJoe WarminskyFebruary 28th, 2024Suspected Iranian cyber-espionage campaign targets Middle East aerospace, defense industriesAn ongoing cyber-espionage campaign that uses unique malware against the aerospace, aviation and defense industries in the Middle East appears to have links to Iran, security researchers say. The operation is targeting entities in Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — and potentially Turkey, India and Albania — according to analysts at Mandiant, the cybersecurity unit for Google Cloud. The campaign began as early as June 2022, and appears to be linked to an Iranian group that Mandiant tracks as UNC1549, which overlaps with another hacking operation labeled Tortoiseshell. That group’s hit list has included Israeli shipping companies and U.S. aerospace and defense companies, and reports have connected it to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Earlier this month, the U.S. sanctioned members of an IRGC unit for attacks against water utilities. The researchers said the potential IRGC connection “is noteworthy given the focus on defense-related entities and the recent tensions with Iran in light of the Israel-Hamas war.” Iran openly supports the Hamas militants in Gaza. Mandiant observed UNC1549 “deploy multiple evasion techniques to mask their activity, most prominently the extensive use of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure as well as social engineering schemes to disseminate two unique backdoors: MINIBIKE and MINIBUS.” The MINIBIKE malware was first spotted in June 2022 and last seen in October 2023. It’s capable of “file exfiltration and upload, command execution, and more,” Mandiant said, and it uses Azure cloud infrastructure. MINIBUS, meanwhile, is a “custom backdoor that provides a more flexible code-execution interface and enhanced reconnaissance features,” the researchers said. They first spotted it in August 2023 and saw it as recently as January. The two pieces of malware cover the usual cyber-espionage checklist, including the harvesting of login credentials to enable further spying, or running other malicious code to clear the way for more activity. The researchers also spotted a custom “tunneler” they labeled LIGHTRAIL. Tunnelers essentially hide malicious activity by wrapping internet traffic inside other traffic.Cybercrime NewsNewsNation-state NewsMalware NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsIranMandiantaerospacedefenseIsraelMiddle Eastcyber-espionageNo previous articleNo new articlesJoe Warminskyis the news editor for Recorded Future News.

      "After decades of memory-related software bugs, White House calls on industry to actLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: Behnam Norouzi via UnsplashJoe WarminskyFebruary 26th, 2024After decades of memory-related software bugs, White House calls on industry to actThe Biden administration is continuing to pressure the tech industry to make products that are secure from the outset, issuing a call on Monday for greater use of memory-safe programming languages. The effort by the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) is aimed at cutting down on a class of bugs that has caused problems since the 1980s: coding errors that allow attackers to abuse how software manages computer memory. Such vulnerabilities can be exploited to breach or corrupt data and run malicious code. “To reduce the attack surface in cyberspace, we must eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities at-scale, by securing the building blocks of cyberspace,” National Cyber Director Harry Coker said in outlining a new technical report that the White House produced for the industry. The report has buy-in from leaders in the tech sector and academia, ONCD noted, touting statements of support from officials at companies such as SAP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Honeywell. The White House says the report “takes an important step toward shifting the responsibility of cybersecurity away from individuals and small businesses and onto large organizations like technology companies” that are “more capable of managing the ever-evolving threat.” The report mentions C and C++ as examples of programming languages that lack “traits associated with memory safety and also have high proliferation across critical systems.” Languages such as Rust, Python and Java are among the recommended replacements. The White House wants executives and not just engineers to pay attention, a senior Biden administration official said in a call with reporters. “We’re hoping that memory safety becomes an agenda item on the next board meeting for many of these companies,” the official said. The report was more than a year in the making and included multiple outreach sessions to the tech industry, the official said, while noting that large companies with many products might have a lot of work to do on the topic. “Migrating to memory-safe code, to be clear, could become a multi-decade effort depending on the size of a company, and requires the attention and support of all,” but those who do it “will make an outsized impact on the security of our nation,” the senior administration official said. The difficulty in making the switch is why “for 35 years we’ve seen our adversaries score points against us,” the official said. But the time is right for industry to shift, the official said, because the technology now exists to make changes. The White House notes that computer memory bugs enabled one of the earliest internet security incidents — the Morris Worm of 1988 — and continue to provide opportunities for attackers today, including the BLASTPASS exploit chain used by a spyware vendor in 2023. The report also calls for the creation of better metrics for measuring the security of software, an effort that will require “pioneering efforts in software engineering and cybersecurity research,” according to a White House fact sheet. The report is the latest followup to President Joe Biden’s 2021 executive order on cybersecurity the release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy in 2023. Other agencies have advocated for the tech industry to think about security as early as possible in developing products. Examples include the Secure By Design initiative from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and a report on minimum elements of a software bill of materials (SBOM) from the Commerce Department. The National Security Agency (NSA) and CISA also issued an information sheet on memory-safe programming in December.Cybercrime NewsGovernment NewsIndustry NewsNewsTechnology NewsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.Tagsmemorymemory leakVulnerabilitybugONCDHarry CokerWhite HouseNo previous articleNo new articlesJoe Warminskyis the news editor for Recorded Future News.

      "‘Alarming’ cyberattack hits Canada’s federal police, criminal investigation launched LeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: waferboard via Flickr / CC BY 2.0Alexander MartinFebruary 26th, 2024‘Alarming’ cyberattack hits Canada’s federal police, criminal investigation launched The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is investigating an “alarming” cyberattack that targeted its networks on Friday, the federal agency announced. In a statement reported by public broadcaster CBC, the RCMP said there was no impact on its operations nor any “known threat to the safety and security of Canadians,” as a result of the incident. The RCMP’s statement said: “While a breach of this magnitude is alarming, the quick work and mitigation strategies put in place demonstrate the significant steps the RCMP has taken to detect and prevent these types of threats.” The nature of the attack has not yet been disclosed. It is not clear if the breach refers to a security incident or to a data protection breach, which would require the attackers to have successfully compromised the RCMP’s network. The RCMP — which retains its iconic name, although its officers are no longer routinely mounted on horseback — is comparable to the FBI in the United States, and holds both domestic and foreign intelligence information. The agency’s statement said the cyberattack had no known impact on its intelligence services. Earlier this year, Canada’’s foreign ministry discovered “malicious cyber activity” on its network that allowed hackers access to personal information. It is not known whether this was a criminal or state-sponsored breach. It follows a separate incident in which data on current and former members of the country’s armed forces and the RCMP was compromised after a contractor providing relocation services for government personnel was hacked.Government NewsNews BriefsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsCanadaLaw enforcementintelligence agencycyberattackPoliceRoyal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)No previous articleNo new articlesAlexander Martinis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Hackers steal nearly $10 million from Axie Infinity co-founder’s personal accountsLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterImage: UnsplashJoe WarminskyFebruary 23rd, 2024Hackers steal nearly $10 million from Axie Infinity co-founder’s personal accountsOne of the co-founders of the video game Axie Infinity and the related Ronin Network had nearly $10 million in cryptocurrency stolen from personal accounts. Reports said wallets belonging to Jeff “Jihoz” Zirlin were hacked to the tune of 3,248 ethereum coins, or about $9.7 million. Zirlin confirmed on social media late Thursday that two of his accounts were compromised. “The attack is limited to my personal accounts, and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain” or Axie Infinity operator Sky Mavis, Zirlin said. Another Ronin Network co-founder, Aleksander Larsen, echoed those comments. It’s unclear how the intruders got access to Zirlin’s wallets. The Ronin Network underpins Axie Infinity, which has a play-to-earn economy based on ethereum. It’s particularly popular in Southeast Asia. Hackers stole $600 million in cryptocurrency from the system in March 2022 — an attack that U.S. prosecutors subsequently attributed to Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed cybercrime operation. On Friday, analysts traced the funds stolen from Zirlin’s accounts to activity on Tornado Cash, a mixer designed to hide the source of cryptocurrency. Lazarus used the mixer to launder funds from the 2022 hack, according to the U.S. government, which separately sanctioned Tornado Cash. Blockchain investigator PeckShield told the publication Cointelegraph that the theft was indeed a “wallet compromise.” “I want to assure everyone that we have strict security measures in place for all chain related activities” for Ronin, Zirlin said. This has been a tough morning for me. Two of my addresses have been compromised.The attack is limited to my personal accounts, and has nothing to do with validation or operations of the Ronin chain.Additionally, the leaked keys have nothing to do with Sky Mavis operations.…— Jihoz.ron (@Jihoz_Axie) February 23, 2024 Cybercrime NewsNewsNews BriefsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsAxie InfinityRonin NetworkHackcryptocurrencyEthereumNo previous articleNo new articlesJoe Warminskyis the news editor for Recorded Future News.

      "Russian citizen faces trial for alleged hacking of local power gridLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterVologda, Russia. Image: Image: Dmitriy Alekseenkoff / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY-SA 3.0Daryna AntoniukFebruary 23rd, 2024Russian citizen faces trial for alleged hacking of local power gridA 49-year-old Russian national will stand trial on charges of carrying out a cyberattack on a local power plant that resulted in a blackout in dozens of settlements, according to the Russian state news agency TASS. The unnamed resident of Vologda, a city in the northwest of Russia, “intentionally” gained illegal access to the technological control systems of local power grids last February and cut off the power supply to 38 settlements in the region, TASS reported, citing a spokesperson from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB). It is not clear how long the alleged blackouts lasted and how many households were affected. There are no additional reports about the incident aside from the statement provided by the Russian FSB to TASS. If proven guilty, the hacker could potentially face up to eight years in prison. He would be charged with using his “official position” to unlawfully access computer information stored on critical information infrastructure, suggesting that he could be an employee of the hacked power plant. Russian law enforcement did not mention whether the alleged attack was financially or politically motivated. The latter scenario seems likely, given that there have been several incidents where tech-savvy Russian residents conducted cyberattacks on critical infrastructure as a form of protest against the current regime or Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Earlier in October, an 18-year-old Russian tech student was detained by the FSB for allegedly helping Ukrainian hackers carry out cyberattacks against Russia. Now he could face treason charges and up to 20 years in prison. In another case in October, a Russian citizen from the Siberian town of Belovo was arrested for supposedly joining Ukrainian cyber forces to execute cyberattacks on critical Russian infrastructure Last year, three residents of the Russian city Rostov-on-Don were sentenced to prison or fined for carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Russian sites.News BriefsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsRussiaCritical InfrastructureHackelectric gridutilitypowerNo previous articleNo new articlesDaryna Antoniukis a reporter for Recorded Future News based in Ukraine.

      "LockBit administrator ‘has engaged with law enforcement,’ police claimLeadershipCybercrimeNation-stateElectionsTechnologyCyber Daily®Click Here PodcastGoSubscribe to The Record✉️ Free NewsletterA screenshot of the seized LockBit website.Alexander MartinFebruary 23rd, 2024LockBit administrator ‘has engaged with law enforcement,’ police claimLockbitSupp, or the individual behind that account representing the ransomware service on cybercrime forums, “has engaged with law enforcement,” police claimed on Friday. An operation led by Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) alongside the FBI, Europol, and other international partners, seized LockBit’s darknet website on Monday. During a press conference in London on Tuesday morning, the NCA’s director general, Graeme Biggar, announced his agency had “gained unprecedented and comprehensive access to LockBit’s systems.” Throughout this week, police have used the seized website to reveal details about the LockBit gang in the same style in which the criminals had previously published details about their extortion attempts, with a countdown timer intended to encourage victims to pay up. In a post published Friday titled “Who is LockbitSupp?,” law enforcement said the account holder had lied about living in the United States or the Netherlands, as well as owning a Lamborghini. “He drives a Mercedes (though parts may be hard to source),” stated the site, potentially referencing the impact on the automotive industry of sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation following the invasion of Ukraine. The post did not contain substantial information about the individual’s identity, but claimed that law enforcement knew who was behind the account. “We know who he is. We know where he lives. We know how much he is worth,” states the message on the seized site, alongside the announcement: “LockbitSupp has engaged with Law Enforcement :).” It is not clear whom the message is targeting. It is not an indictment against a specific individual — a legal allegation that must be supported by evidence — nor does it name an individual for the purposes of imposing financial and travel sanctions.Cybercrime NewsGovernment NewsNewsNews BriefsGet more insights with the Recorded FutureIntelligence Cloud.Learn more.TagsLockBitRansomwareNCAFBItakedownNo previous articleNo new articlesAlexander Martinis the UK Editor for Recorded Future News.
